This is what I love about doing projects. They take reality and smack whatever delusions of grandure you have about yourself. 

This project has really tested me so far...

The truth that I am grappling with is that I want everything immediately, when programming takes time. I must go through the workflow. 

Start with HTML, then do CSS and then finally javascript.

Youtube really helped me with this project. Not only are there walkthrough for the project, but also there were plenty of full turtorials for the additions that I wanted to make. 

Don't give up.
